    <p>#Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. 
#Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
#For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.</p>
